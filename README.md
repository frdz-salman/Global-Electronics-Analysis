## Project Background

Global Electronics Retailer is a multinational company selling a wide range of consumer electronics through both online and physical stores. The time series dataset contains details on customers, locations, products, sales, stores, and deliveries. The purpose of the analysis is to understand user behavior, identify trends, evaluate category performance, and provide data-driven recommendations to improve customer experience.

## Executive Summary

An analysis of 61,672 sales records with 25,828 orders from 2016 to 2020 shows that annual revenue has stabilized at approximately $10.9 million, with North America contributing 61.9% and EMEA 33.3% of total sales. Most customers fall within the productive age range of 25 to 54 years. The product mix is dominated by Computers and Home Appliances, which together generate 64% of total revenue. In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic significantly slowed growth and negatively impacted customer retention. The average delivery time stands at 4.55 days, though outliers warrant closer monitoring. Physical stores outperform online channels, generating nearly four times more revenue. For sustained growth, the company should target expansion in Australia and strengthen its digital presence to enhance customer engagement.

## Clarifying Questions, Assumptions, and Caveats

### Questions for Stakeholders

1. What is the target timeframe for revenue recovery given the ongoing impact of COVID-19 in 2021?
2. Are there any plans to develop mobile apps or improve the existing online platform given the large gap in online vs offline performance?
3. Are there ongoing initiatives for Australian market entry?
4. RFM implementation and governance:
   - What is the budget allocation strategy for each RFM segment?
   - Are there clear criteria and timelines for discontinuing RFM strategies if they are not delivering the expected improvements?
   - Is there a commitment to establish a dedicated analytics team to monitor and optimize RFM-based strategies continuously?

### Assumptions and Limitations

- Q1 2021 are available in the dataset. To prevent skewed insights, this period has been excluded from key trend analyses and annual comparisons .
- Transaction Completeness: The analysis assumes all customer transactions are captured in the dataset, whereas there may be purchases or returns outside the system.
- Digital Adoption: The assumption that digital investment will increase online sales may not hold true if customer preference remains skewed towards physical stores .
